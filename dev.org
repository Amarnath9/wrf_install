*Note 2015-02-19*: I am not really keen to implementing the following. I feel
that doing following is stretching these scripts too far and also I have no
need for doing it.

* NEXT write status file of each app
status of each may be
- installed
- broken
- installed with these dependencies

* TODO writing parts of wrf_install with perl
it makes sense because installing wrf needs perl anyway. so we are not
imposing any new dependency. But version of perl required should as old
as possible
